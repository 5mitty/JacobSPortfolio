## Description

This is a Vehicle Management System! This command-line application allows users to efficiently manage a virtual garage by creating, selecting, and controlling various types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and motorbikes. Users can perform actions such as starting, accelerating, and reversing their vehicles with ease. Throughout the development of this application, I gained valuable experience working with the Inquirer package for user input, organizing multiple source files for better structure, and implementing interfaces to enhance the responsiveness of the CLI program. This project aims to provide a seamless and interactive experience for vehicle management enthusiasts
